Nose of white pineapple, sticks on the nose in a viscous lemon oil way. Savoury mixed green herbs and grilled peaches.
The palate is an equally complex attack of melon and creamy kiwi. The finish is salty and mineral focused with a slight sweet lift. The mouth feel and particularly the nose grow in breadth and weight as it opens.
A truly sublime pairing with grilled asparagus, sauce Gribiche, ham, Parmesan and lemon oil.",talks about taste

"SCOTT WHITE RECOMMENDATION

Scott has steered me to some great wines. Whispering angel ros√© , Honig SB, and this. 

I cringed a bit on the price but said I‚Äôm worth it. So glad I did. 

Lots of tropical and citrus flavors with a touch of oak. Peach on the finish. 

90 point wine enthusiast. ",talks about taste
"This bottle is now seven years old. I saved it because I wanted to see how it might age. It‚Äôs still gorgeous, and one of my favorite whites. Softer, rounder, fuller. Ripe Asian pear, peach, honey, a bit of butter and caramel from the oak as well. The citrus is still there, tangerine and grapefruit, but more in the background.",talks about taste
Love the spicy note sitting on top of the gooseberry awesome sauvignon blanc for Californian but expect nothing less from Merry of course.,talks about taste
"Fantastic sonoma sauvignon blanc with a complex profile. Flavors of  white peach, tangerine, lemon, grass, guava, pineapple, coconut, vanilla, and a hint of minerality. Oak barrel fermentation gives it a softer acidity but adds more character and a creamy texture.",talks about taste
"I found this at the back of my cellar and thought it was maybe 4 years past prime. I was surprised - it still has a lot of life left in it. Sweet palate, notes of pink grapefruit and mon zest. Mouthfeel is creamy. Bright but mellowed acidity. ",talks about taste
"Stop. This is the one.  Better than Lail, Cuvasion or any other California Sav Blanc.  Measure all against this near perfect wine. Pale straw in color with notes of tropical fruit and lemon zest

Light bodied with crisp fruit expression.  Acidity comes in waves with a harmonious blend of fruit making this finish clean and dry. 

The palate is white peach, honey crisp apple, with hints of lime and tart kiwi
95pts",talks about taste
What impresses me most is this is a premium Sauvignon blanc isn‚Äôt overly fruity in an way like a lot of others but it has a mellow cornucopia of fruit.  Melon strawberry honey dew blueberry.  You name it and it‚Äôs got it and it‚Äôs a little crispy but a little soft and oaky.  So excellent ,talks about taste

I love this. Balance balance balance.  This is delicious white wine. Ty for this",talks about taste
"Barrel fermented with lees stiring
Open quite grassy and evolves to white peach, floral (frangipani), corn and a touch of vanilla.
The palate has moderate acidity, good concentration, firm texture, a slightly warming alcohol with a touch of bitterness and good length.
This really benefits from aeration. It became a lot more aromatic and gained weight. Drinking well now, but should evolve in bottle for another 2-3years.",talks about taste

Great sauv Blanc. Rich and fruity. Plenty of thick citrus flavor. It's velvety and buttery texture pairs nice with the deep pear and melon notes that appear at the finish. Probably the best sauv Blanc I've had. The oak is there but not overly perceptible. I'm so impressed at the balance of this wine. It doesn't do anything funky and let's you settle into a great summer day afternoon drink.,talks about taste
"2017 Vintage 
Enjoyed August 2019. 
Needed very little time to open. Quite an enjoyable Sauv Blanc. My notes are similar to those of Rocky T. Smooth, creamy, wonderful hints of citrus, melon with the addition of pear and peach flavors. Nice oak notes. I can understand if this would be too sweet or fruity for some, but I find that to be valuable to this SB, memorable, wanting more. This will be a go to for me.

Although this is the last vintage where they sourced fruit from non estate vineyards. This gives much more fruit characteristics than the estate vineyards.

They managed to take a varietal I generally regard as simple with limited variation that attempts to win the crowd with sweetness, and made it into a sleek, finessed version that tamed the fruit and made this a serious wine.

The addition of 30% Sauvignon Musqu√© gave this wine a completely new dimension, with notes of honeysuckle, cantaloupe, ginger, and white peach.

"An interesting and delicious sauv blanc. It has the brightness and acid of a sauv blanc (typical notes like melon and peach) but the fullness and opulence of a refined chardonnay. The oak comes through as an undertone, not a confection. Would buy a case if I could find it!",talks about taste
"Blind, I thought this was Viognier. It‚Äôs very floral, ripe, with a creamy, round texture you rarely see in Sauvignon Blanc. It also has lower acidity than what I would expect from Sauv Blanc, but enough to mostly balance out the opulent fruit. This isn‚Äôt typical by any means, but it‚Äôs fun and complex. Drink now ",other
"I'm already back for more of this Sauvignon Blanc (and I'm not big on whites generally). I'm enjoying like I'd normally a good red, and GF likes it too. So, rich and flavored.  Must chill, tho. It's pricey, but a treat. It's pushing 5* in my book.",talks about taste
"Really something. My favourite California white thus far, by far. Not the crisp sav blanc I‚Äôm used to with the NZ wines, but much richer.

Lots of tropical notes, with some guava, pineapple, elderflower, orange, and orange peel, with pineapple, key lime, and a little coconut on the palate. Some stone minerality too, and just a little nutty (cashew?) note.",talks about taste
