review
"Easily the best Sauvignon Blanc I've had to date. Beautiful array of flavors on the nose with lemon, apple, honey, peach and other citrus. A great balance of acidity and a slight buttery flavor in the mid palate. Smooth and medium finish. Definitely worth having again. "
"Excellent, Mockingbird Inn?
"
Absolutely incredible. One of the best sauvignon blancs I've ever had the pleasure to taste
Reported in nytimes. Did not try
"Great. Much different than other Sauv Blancs since it is aged in oak. After a few days open in the fridge, it was way better!"
"This was a nice, balanced, SVB. Just enough Apple and citrus, light on the grass, but enough flavor to enjoy. "
"Oak and stone first, followed by a little peach. Finishes with some apricot and green apple. Very good bottle for the price!"
"Stunning, delicious, sophisticated, incomparable to other SB's. A very welcome addition to the wonderful world of SB's."
Fantastic expression of Napa Sav Blanc.  Incredible peach undertones that went well with our grilled peach and avo salad
"I think this is my first Cali Sauvignon Blanc. Fruity, honeysuckle, maybe a little oily? Slightly sweet. "
One of the best Sauv Blancs made.. only accolades.. smooth and crisp up front with a memorable finish..
"Another bottle and another great dinner (soft shell crabs).  Drink this wine. Great balance, fruit and verve. "
Clean and pear up front with a beautiful subtle butter and spicy finish. One of the better sav blancs 
"Smooth and slightly sweet with pear, apple, and mango notes. Medium bodied and we'll balanced. Pairs well with cheese."
"Honey, pear and grilled pineapple on the nose.  Earthy on the palate with pear, mild grapefruit and green apple."
One of the better Sauvignon Blancs I‚Äôve tasted. Pear and apple palate with a good mix of minerality and butter. 
"Dry, high acidity, high alcohol, medium bodied. Grass, vanilla and liquorice on the palate. Very good quality!"
Crisp and tart flavors upfront with a nice sweet pear finish. Aromas of wild flowers and honey suckle. Exceptional wine!
Dry. Very fruit forward with no bad linger on the palate. Bought a bottle after our tasting and enjoy it just much now.
"Love this wine. Medium - Full bodied, low sweetness, and medium - high acidity. Melon and citrus, mmmm!!"
Still a favorite.. deep color and pleasant tones of pear. Good enough to match a spicy pork dish! melon 
Mainly honeydew melon with pear overtones. Very enjoyable and more substantial than ‚Äòpopular‚Äô sauv blancs. 
Grapefruit lime mineral notes.  Lite residual sugar mild smooth med plus acid med complexity easy drinking good food wine.
"Gorgeous!  Strong gooseberry on the nose, but oh the ripeness of fruit that shows peaches and tropical fruit! Excellent!"
Pear and melon with clean drink. Almost like German white that I remember. Maybe pepper finish. I‚Äôd drink again
What a simply lovely wine - thank you Kelly & Kyle for thoughtfully providing it - well worth trying! üëçüòÉ
"Super sweet kiwi, pineapple, and white peaches. Super easy drinking and delish! Refreshing and lovely :)"
Candied apricot gives way to peach on the finish. Absolutely delightfully delicious with bacon wrapped sea scallops. 
Amazing fruit notes of apple in nose. French oak gives it a little twist in texture. Merry never disappoints! 
"Great sauv blanc for price. Very smooth and well balanced with some banana and apple hints, seems to be lower acidity "
"Crisp, with a hint of minerality and cream flavor; citrus, peach and flowers on the nose. Very nice wine."
"Wow. Awesome wine, passion fruit, vanilla, incredibly soft on the tongue. Paid $33 and well worth it. "
Fruity and creamy smooth with hints of pear and sweet apple.  Paired really well with Japanese food.  Enjoyed it very much.
Very floral nose. Not too sweet. Peaches. Soft in the mouth. Bought this at the vineyard after a very educational tasting.
delicious! Kind of syrupy but not sweet. Has a strong grape üçá flavor. Unlike New Zealand Sauvignon Blanca
"Golden color with floral and green apple aroma, fruity little creamy, taste of honey with hint of caramel, very nice"
Delicious. Very complex. Nice crisp apple with a long finish. Obama had this in cases - maybe at inauguration. 
Love this! Pineapple and Pear off set by smooth butter. Fantastic expression of Sauvignon Blanc and welcome departure from an acid bomb. 
"Great Sauvignon Blanc,  one of the best I‚Äôve tasted with Green Apple and Honey flavors on the palate."
On the frutier side for SBs. Great taste of melon that fills the mouth. Awesome bottle design as well 
"Pale pale straw, pear and sweetness on the nose that continues on the palate. Almost tastes like a late harvest"
"I saw a creamy pear comment and I feel like that was a spot on description, good first impression.  $40"
"This wine is just balanced, smooth, beautiful. Round melon, mineral, pear. It‚Äôs just delicious. Perfect Sauvignon Blanc "
"Definitely a tropical fruit forward, flavorful SB. Full body and concentration can stand up to rich shrimp and lobster. "
"Pleasant scent, light pear on the nose. Pear, hints of earth and a finish of green apple on the tongue. Light and mildly bright."
"A strange sauv Blanc, creamy and rich with a peppery finish.  A hint of sweetness.  I would have sworn it was a Viognier."
"Very good sauvignon blanc, but in american style; fuller and fruitier than the Europeans. Balance is very good though."
"This is the dream. Almost creamy on the finish, more depth than one would expect from a Sauv. Could drink this all day! "
"Hot vintage, light colour and golden green flecks.
Nose of white pineapple, sticks on the nose in a viscous lemon oil way. Savoury mixed green herbs and grilled peaches.
The palate is an equally complex attack of melon and creamy kiwi. The finish is salty and mineral focused with a slight sweet lift. The mouth feel and particularly the nose grow in breadth and weight as it opens.
A truly sublime pairing with grilled asparagus, sauce Gribiche, ham, Parmesan and lemon oil."
"House. Nicely balanced, feels like some oak or perhaps lees? Honeydew melon, honey, rosemary, papaya. Complex and more fruit forward / lower acid. Probably would not have guessed Sauvignon blanc. Bubblegum.  Refreshing, thirst-quenching"
"SCOTT WHITE RECOMMENDATION

Scott has steered me to some great wines. Whispering angel ros√© , Honig SB, and this. 

I cringed a bit on the price but said I‚Äôm worth it. So glad I did. 

Lots of tropical and citrus flavors with a touch of oak. Peach on the finish. 

90 point wine enthusiast. "
"This bottle is now seven years old. I saved it because I wanted to see how it might age. It‚Äôs still gorgeous, and one of my favorite whites. Softer, rounder, fuller. Ripe Asian pear, peach, honey, a bit of butter and caramel from the oak as well. The citrus is still there, tangerine and grapefruit, but more in the background."
Love the spicy note sitting on top of the gooseberry awesome sauvignon blanc for Californian but expect nothing less from Merry of course.
"Fantastic sonoma sauvignon blanc with a complex profile. Flavors of  white peach, tangerine, lemon, grass, guava, pineapple, coconut, vanilla, and a hint of minerality. Oak barrel fermentation gives it a softer acidity but adds more character and a creamy texture."
"I found this at the back of my cellar and thought it was maybe 4 years past prime. I was surprised - it still has a lot of life left in it. Sweet palate, notes of pink grapefruit and mon zest. Mouthfeel is creamy. Bright but mellowed acidity. "
"Stop. This is the one.  Better than Lail, Cuvasion or any other California Sav Blanc.  Measure all against this near perfect wine. Pale straw in color with notes of tropical fruit and lemon zest

Light bodied with crisp fruit expression.  Acidity comes in waves with a harmonious blend of fruit making this finish clean and dry. 

The palate is white peach, honey crisp apple, with hints of lime and tart kiwi
95pts"
What impresses me most is this is a premium Sauvignon blanc isn‚Äôt overly fruity in an way like a lot of others but it has a mellow cornucopia of fruit.  Melon strawberry honey dew blueberry.  You name it and it‚Äôs got it and it‚Äôs a little crispy but a little soft and oaky.  So excellent 
"A medium plus body SB, round, showing oak notes, lees, and more on stone fruit and tropical, high alcohol but concentrated, quite long"
Benchmark Cali Sauv B. Balanced wine. The fruit is ripe but not overly so.
Awaesome white !!! Enjoy with friends !!
Oaked sauvignon blanc - really awesome combination
"Different for a sauv blanc, crisp but richer than normal. Very good."
Even better when drinking in Sonoma
"Great Sauvignon Blanc!!! Aromas of melon, pear, minerals. High acidity/freshness in the mouth."
"Wow‚Ä¶ impressive robust Sauvignon Blanc ‚Ä¶ green apple, pear cotton mineral lime   Beautiful"

"So many tropical flavors with clear oak usage to provide complexity.

Pale lemon color. Grass, pear, grapefruit, green apple skin, pineapple, white blossom, and nectarine nose. Dry. High acidity. Cream, pineapple, lychee, vanilla, and lime zest."
"Light golden color. Nose: pear, pineapple, cotton candy & and bit of sage. Mouth: pineapple, pear, modest residual sugar, medium+ acid & a hint of bitterness. A long pear & sage finish.

ABV 14%. I think this is from the Maefield Estate Vineyard. Varietals: Sauvignon Blanc Shenandoah (Clone 1) - 67% & Sauvignon Musque- 33%. 5 mos in French oak (18% new) with batonnage 2x/wk. Definitely better after at least an hour slow-ox. Wine Spectator 95."
"Color: Light yellow
Viscosity: High
Aromas: Mango, Tropical, Guava, Honey, Pineapple, Mineral melon 
Tannins: None
Acidity: Medium
Alcohol: 14.0%.
Grape Varietal: 100% Sauvignon Blanc
Impression: Not much herbaceousness typical of Sauvignon Blanc. Tropical and easy to drink."
"Sauvignon Blanc from Russian River, Sonoma üá∫üá∏ While I acknowledge this a wine with good complexity, the intense oaky aromas/flavors are overwhelming. It reminds me an oaky Chardonnay. Full-bodied with M acidity."
"Bare naked ladies 4th vintage (not todayüòÇ). It's hot here for mid-October, mid 80sF (30C). SB helpedü•µ. Structured, complex & aromatic; the vintage I've enjoyed the most so far.

Pale yellowüëÅ, aromas of elderflower, pineappleüçç, melon, citrus zest & the barestüòâ hint of green herbs.

Dry but ripe. Round & lush palate, med-full body (14%). Balanced by the crisp, med(+)acidity.

Unctuous palate of white peachüçë, quince & lychee. Vanilla & a sprinkle of white pepper midüëÖ. Chalky slate finish with a saline edge."
"Pale in the color. On the nose citrus pear peach oak tropical lemon melon pineapple cream butter green apple stone fruit honeyamazing nose. On the mouth pairs the nose has an oak, citrus, cream toasted coconut has a medium-full body for a Sauvignon Blanc, medium acidity, medium-long finish. Very good wine."
"This Sb thinks its a chardonnay. And its great. As a matter of fact, it is a chardonnay. Or at least a killer white bordeaux blend. Top notch somms would swear that this is a chard. Not the leafy vegetable. 

Wow. Yum. You guys do it up. Not cheap, mind you. But goooood. 

I love this. Balance balance balance.  This is delicious white wine. Ty for this"
"Barrel fermented with lees stiring
Open quite grassy and evolves to white peach, floral (frangipani), corn and a touch of vanilla.
The palate has moderate acidity, good concentration, firm texture, a slightly warming alcohol with a touch of bitterness and good length.
This really benefits from aeration. It became a lot more aromatic and gained weight. Drinking well now, but should evolve in bottle for another 2-3years."
"Pale lemon in color with a youthful medium plus intensity on the nose. Citrus, oak, peach, pear, tropical fruit, melon, cream. Dry, medium plus acid, full bodied, high alcohol and medium plus intensity on the body. Long finish. Oak, cream, vanilla, citrus, lemon, tropical fruit. This wine definitely sees some oak aging and is not your NZ zippy sauv Blanc. Minerals. Outstanding quality of wine. Can drink now, suitable for aging."
"@[1|63584282|Abbey Weis] blinded me. Appearance: pale lemon-green, no rim variation. Nose: med intensity. White blossom, honeysuckle. Green apple, yellow apple. Something metallic. White peach, bruised apple, candied. Oil. Tropical. Palate: dry, but not exactly - heavy fruit. Medium acid. Med+ body. Luscious mouthfeel. High alcohol. Med+ flavor intensity. Minerality, white pepper or spice. Oak? Peach, banana, bitter acidity, red apple. Ripe fruits. Finish is med to med+ - Bitter acidity. Guessed NY Riesling. Good!"
"Very elegant with Medium intensity aromas and flavors of apple, pineapple, apricot, white peach, nectarine, elderflower, brioche, clove, vanilla and smoke.
Hint of dried apricot and honey.
Very good quality, balancing aromatics with a hint of oak. Interesting style with batonnage, 18% new French oak."

Merry Edwards
Sauvignon Blanc 2022.
This is the first time for me to taste this beautiful Sauvignon Blanc.
Merry Edwards Winery was founded in 1997 by one of California‚Äôs first highly successful female winemakers.
The winery‚Äôs vineyards are influenced by the Pacific Ocean, cooling fog, sandy soils and other attributes that lead to the production of rich, ageable wines.
Silky smooth, bright acidity, complex and balanced.
Aroma from lemon, pineapple, lime zest, acacia, melon, vanilla and minerals."
Absolutely amazing Sauvignon Blanc. Fruity and very soft with mostly citrus and maybe some green apple. Very well built and √©quilibrated . Soft but flavorful. Pairs very well with light seafood like scallops.
"wonderful peach‚Ä¶ full, sweet sauv b"
"Buttery, pear, good amount of sweetness, refreshing, pairs well with fish "
All time favorite Sauvignon Blanc beautiful honeysuckle and floral notes. Can‚Äôt describe the magic on my tongue! So amazing. 
I got the yummy in my mouth and it‚Äôs because of you.
"Light, slightly dry & mildly acidic with notes of melon, peach, citrus, caramel, butter and oak"
Tropical yet fresh. 
"The 2019 didn‚Äôt disappoint. Pear forward with a hint of melon, slightly citrus finish balanced perfectly with boiled lobster."
Beautiful wine.  Agree with WS94 notes.  
Big Canyon wine tasting.  
Smoky...and smooth and sultry.  Enjoy.
"Just a fabulous, balanced near perfect wine."
Omg. These grapes were pressed into service against their will.  Better than dying on the vine.
Its more a sauvignon than a blanc. Sophisticated and is more rounded than your average blanc. Its reaaal good. Never disappoints but its just a bit expensive for a bottle of white wine isnt it?
"Had at John & Gail‚Äôs, incredibly light and yummy "
citrus oak peach pear tropical melon
Soft and smooth. Not acidic.  A Sauvignon blanc for the Chardonnay lover 
"Pear on the nose and palette. Floral, light honey, melon, touch of butter. On the sweeter side but with crisp acidity, heavier body, almost jammy. Complex, refreshing, delightful."
"ÊüëÊ©òÈ°û „Ç™„Éº„ÇØ Ê°É Ê¥ãÊ¢® „Éà„É≠„Éî„Ç´„É´È¢® „É°„É≠„É≥ „Ç∞„É¨„Éº„Éó„Éï„É´„Éº„ÉÑ „Éë„Ç§„Éä„ÉÉ„Éó„É´
The wine is an excellent white. That's great as it is sharp and dry. That doesn't emphasize grape sweetness"
"2019 4.5 pts No Indian barbeque is complete without this bottle. This time we pared it with light tomato-based egg curry, and it worked like a charm."
"Caramel, grass, butter, and citrus on the nose.  Further tastes of grapefruit, lemon, pear, and vanilla.  Very good Sauvignon blanc"
"Clean, pure, balanced. Well-integrated fruit.  Calming nose.  Slight pepper finish.  As good as you‚Äôre going to get from a Cali White."
"Nice and pleasant wine. Sweeter initially then I expected, but still not overbearing and at the right moment pivots off to a crisp finish. "
"Beautiful, crisp White.  Similar to some of the nice Bordeaux whites.  Worth the extra money if you like a fuller body savignon blanc vs. a thinner less expensive one."
"Great Wine, oak shows but not as much as a Chardonnay.  Not as crisp and acidic as typical sauvignon blanc. Would definitely buy again. "
"A really superior Sauvignon Blanc, rich and complex.  Pear, apple, citrus , honeydew and honey with moderate acidity.  Honey lingers on the palate. A real treat"
"Slightly on the heavier side for a sauv blanc with a little oakiness.  Lots tropical fruit, stone fruit, some pear and a bit of citrus.  A bit of spice and vanilla.  Very smooth finish.  "
"Dark straw color.  Medium to full body for a Sauvignon Blanc.  Well balanced with light acidity.  Delicious grapefruit, honey, apple and ripe pineapple.  Long finish with  light minerals."
One of the better whites I‚Äôve tasted in while.  Earthy and floral aroma.  Bold fruit upfront that settles into a very mince finish.  Not too sweet and not too sour!  Just right!
"Pale yellow with pleasing aromas of citrus and tropical fruits, adding in spice and some biscuit notes. On the palate complex palate of flavors, fresh fruit, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, peaches and Asian pears. Slight earthiness with a smooth and creamy well balanced finish ending with a gentle yeasty character. Very nice! Consistent quality! Will age well!"
"One of my all time fav wines - hugely tropical, with floral notes and honey dew melon. Tastes sweet but is dry. Medium body and very elegant"
"Clear, pale lemon. Clean, medium plus intensity aroma of pineapple, honeysuckle, lemon curd. Dry, medium plus acidity, medium body and long finish."
Great sauv Blanc. Rich and fruity. Plenty of thick citrus flavor. It's velvety and buttery texture pairs nice with the deep pear and melon notes that appear at the finish. Probably the best sauv Blanc I've had. The oak is there but not overly perceptible. I'm so impressed at the balance of this wine. It doesn't do anything funky and let's you settle into a great summer day afternoon drink.
"2017 Vintage 
Enjoyed August 2019. 
Needed very little time to open. Quite an enjoyable Sauv Blanc. My notes are similar to those of Rocky T. Smooth, creamy, wonderful hints of citrus, melon with the addition of pear and peach flavors. Nice oak notes. I can understand if this would be too sweet or fruity for some, but I find that to be valuable to this SB, memorable, wanting more. This will be a go to for me. 
4.5-4.75"
"Wow, this is a real treat, a beautifully balanced Cali sauvignon blanc. On the nose, there is a honeyed tropicality which partners with the usual grassy grapefruit. The palate unfolds as I taste more, with an ethereal body complementing the vibrant acidity. A finish for days. A truly lovely wine.

Thank you for the lovely gift, @[1|3969744|Carlos V]!"
"This may be the best CA Sauvignon Blanc I‚Äôve had. Fantastic structure though not overly acidic and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Complex wine with lingering finish. Lemon, lemon curd, floral notes. Super impressed with this wine."
"Great Sauvignon blanc from one of our favorite producers. Sharp and acidic with a bit more alcohol than a typical Sauvignon blanc, this is a big bold wine. Melon pear apple and other tree fruits. It‚Äôs decadent while also being crisp. A great choice on a warm summer night. Can‚Äôt wait for the next bottle of this."
"This is a consistently excellent Sauvignon Blanc from a steroid producer. The color is pale and straw. The nose and palate are perfectly synchronized with lovely notes of honeydew, apple, pear, and pineapple. There is none of that yucky acidic, grapefruit note that most producers are known for. The acidity is spot on. Delicious."
"Dominus the Palate: Dominus & Beyond wine dinner at The Oven with Roland Herman, maison marques + domaines, attended with Nat & Ellingson‚Äôs 6/19/24. Merry was one of California‚Äôs first women winemakers & hated Sauv Blanc so drinks more like a Chardonnay. 1/3 highly floral Sauvignon Musque clone from Sancerre & 2/3 Shenandoah clone with classic herbal & grassy character. 18% new pack 6mo with biweekly lees stirring. Melon, apple & hints of kiwi. Paired with Bhutanese Vege. $59"
"One of my all time favorite Sav Blancs, beautiful floral aroma, with a mix of citrus and melon, beautifully balanced with the right crispness. Exceptional."
"Wow!  As a nightcap watching my Falcons !

Huge nectarine, orange peel, soft vanilla infused oak moment.  Aging has added a subtle enjoyable oxidation! Wow!!! "
"Absolutely amazing burst of citrus with notes of honey, apricot, and pear. Would drink again and again. Paired it with a vegetable orzo in caramelized tomato sauce with shrimp."
"Would have guessed it was a chard almost. Really smooth. Very different than any other sav blanc and in a good/cool way

"Simply delicious summer fare.  However, similar quality available from down under for much less $. Enjoy."
"had the 2019. pretty solid sauv blanc‚Äî had nice balance and reasonable complexity without too many vegetal elements. got notes of carmelized pear, hay, lemongrass, and crisp green apple. some ML occurred, as i felt it on the palate and in the slight butter flavors. however, not worth $50."
Had in Vegas - just tasted since I ordered for everyone.  Sweeter. On the floral side.  Good for wine newbies.  Not overly complex.  Not boring though.  Fruity bouquet and pleasing to the masses. 
"Flavors of tropical fruit are dominant, but also melon, pear, lemon, floral honeysuckle, and definitely spent some time in oak with butter and sur lie with that creaminess."
"Beautiful Sauvignon Blanc with intense, ripe fruits. Citrus, mango, pineapple, balanced 
"
Wonderful fruit forward very drinkable wine!

Wow! Green apple with citrus and mineral undertones with very nice balance and smoothness. Not tart at all. Will definitely stock up on for summer 
"CA SB probably does t get better than this. Medium bodied and elegant with lemon tart, nectarine, and tropical fruit. Pricy for SB but worth it."
"Wine 2...

First RR SB and what an experience.  Oak with SB, so interesting.  Complex, buttery, lemony, straight up delicious!"
"Always top quality Sauvignon, but at a premium. Citrus on the nose leads to creamy pear, honeydew and grapefruit. Intoxicating."
Amazing SB. Finishes with some strong minerality with a melon ball.  Get a juicy stone fruit in there.  Not green apple.but citrus
"Citrus zest on nose, medium body, dry, acidic, complex palate.  Outstanding Sauvignon Blanc for a good price.  Merry Edwards rocks!  93/100."
"An exquisite wine.  So much floral and fruit aromas.  Not the usual grassy nose that is common for the varietal. A very classy, elegant wine. "
"Beautiful as always. Perfect with so many foods, especially on Valentine's. This wine never fails to impress. Merry's  version of SB is sublime. "
"Golden color, nose is fruity. Just trying a small sip. Very smooth, very crisp. Beautiful notes of various apples. Absolutely delicious."
"Crisp green apple and pear. Picked up on some oak notes. Reminiscent of a Chardonnay. Delightful, well balanced wine that leaves you wanting more. "
Never thought Sauvignon Blanc could be this sophisticated. An eye opening experience and reminder of how you can be humbled. 
"Bright citrus scents: lemon, maybe grapefruit.  Lemon and tropical fruits--grapefruit or dragon fruit.  Crisp and brightly acidic. "
Best California Sauvignon Blanc.  Medium gold color Balanced with melon citrus and hint of grass  Reminds me of my favorite French Sancerre 
"I can't praise this one enough. Great citrus and flowery nose, and similar palate. No grassiness at all. Went very well with a scallop crudo. "
"Pale yellow color, lemon & honeydew on nose, fruity, peach with mineral, lovely brightness, roundness on finish, well balanced medium body white."
The perfect Sauvignon Blanc. A bit sweeter than traditional SB but offsets the medium-plus acidity. Dry and tart. Fan. Fukn. Tastic.

Soft finish. Not too strong in any direction in terms of flavor profile.

"Subtle and refined. Papaya and br√ªl√©ed grapefruit, touch of honeysuckle. Delicious. "
"Apple on the nose, citrus, green apple, and sherry on the palate."
Wow. Best Sauvignon Blanc I can remember. Really fresh melon lychee. I‚Äôll look to buy this again. 
Toasty and delicious similar to a good chardonnay
I enjoyed this 2020 just as much as the 2018. Lovely fruit with a beautiful creamy and oily palate and a long finish.
"Very smooth, Melon, pear, citrus , vanilla, grapefruit. Two votes of 4.4 and 4.3. Dinner at La Gare in Santa Rosa."
"Consistently great. Had this at the Mazzeos‚Äô house for a poker night in 4.28.23, with them and Janice. Great night!"
"Top notch! Apple, pear, and lemon notes on the nose. Ripe pear flavors and slight citrus up front. Buttery and smooth with minerals and floral in the middle and end that are just right. This paired beautifully with wood-fired pizza, arugula and cauliflower. Highly recommend."
"Pale straw colored and showing nice viscosity in the glass it wafts aromas of lemon chiffon. The nuanced yellow apple, starfruit, bell pepper, honeysuckle & white pepper flavors on the palate show with lean lightly salted mineral in excellent balance. This medium bodied wine is set with medium acidity, finishing with a tiny glint of hazelnut. Bx92, ws95"
"Ripe, rich, and enticing. Plenty tropical aroma with a a uniquely nutty twist and extra heavy mouthfeel from new oak fermentation and lee aging. The weight of the wine is reflected by the weight of the bottle (thick glass for extra effect). Bring this wine to any dinner party, your guests will be impressed."

Palate: off-dry (has a touch of RS), medium + acidity, medium alcohol, medium body with a creamy mouthfeel, pronounced intensity of flavors that confirm the nose, long finish 

Outstanding wine, drink now. 
Less .2 because ~$50 can get a lot of great wine outside of Sauvignon Blanc."
"The aroma is compelling, virtually reaching out and grabbing our attention. Yellow peach, melon, guava and crisp Fuji apple are accented with hints of tropical mango and pineapple. Lime, Minneola tangelo and orange blossom lend citrus notes. Accents of dry summer grass, vanilla-toned panna cotta and toasted cr√®me br√ªl√©e create complexity.¬†"
"Straw yellow. Lovely aromatic peach, pear, apricot, cinnamon nose. Sweet stone fruit palate. Medium plus body, firm acidity, smooth finish. The common Sauvignon blanc clone is blended with 30% Sauvignon musque, giving it higher residual sugar to support the sweet experience."
"Straw in color, and notes of pineapple, tropical fruit, lemon zest, and a hint of oak. Extremely well balanced with slight acidity. Notes of citrus, tropical fruit, pineapple, and a hint of vanilla from the oak. Amazing California Sauvignon Blanc"
"THE BEST SAUV I‚ÄôVE EVER TASTED. Holy schmoly!!!! A knockout of a wine. Oaky and buttery, has some beautifully seductive caramel toasty notes‚Ä¶but also passion fruit, rose and hints of honeysuckle. showstopper. Oooh! Mind blowing. ü§Ø"
"Clear Lt lemon yellow. Clean, delicate juicy apricot mineral. Lt body med-acid Lt alcohol. Fresh bright mid. Long mineral lemon finish. 100% neural French oak. 6-8 month surlee. Very tasty delicate unique fume blanc. "
Very floral on nose and palate. Pale straw hue with prominent Lily of the Valley perfume and baby‚Äôs breath. Moderately acidic with cantaloupe melon and peach coming through. Well rounded in body and mouthfeel.
"One of the most buttery Sauvignons I‚Äôve had. Plenty lime and green apple, passion fruit, and peach coming to the front palate. Summer cut grass and herbaceous notes of green bell pepper. Not the most frugal buy but for that special one - she will absolutely love it."
"Fantastic, it has undertones of oak but still has that classic SB flavor, it‚Äôs really well balanced and smooth: a truly unique Sauvignon Blanc "
"Amazing wine. Easy drinking, full of flavor, and refreshing. Tangy. Hints of butter. Peaches. Crisp apples, like the crunchy kinds. Spiced vanilla. Really good. "
"Absolutely insane glass!
Not at all what you think when you say Sb.
Completely liquid gold, melted in the mouth.
Notes of: citrus fruit, oak, cream, honey."
"What a beautiful Sav Blanc
Crisp and a hint of sweetness probably from the white peach üçë hints
Learned at the winery that they make 10k cases of this wine 
Loved it"

"Truly delicious, made in the classic old- world style.  Beautiful balance of fruit and acidity.  A real treasure from the Russian River!"
"Dry white with honey, apple and minerality. Very good"
Had at Bully Boy with oysters and tuna wraps. It was amazing.

Great üíñ
"Top notch sauv blanc, stone fruit and citrus notes, but a balanced sweetness contributed to a higher than expected abv at 14% - notes of honeysuckle"
2/13/24 Leigh Ann B brought to book club night at our house. E & I enjoyed w/ caviar on V-day.
"Round soft mouthfeel - much smoother than the average Sauvignon Blanc. Very smooth with notes of pear, lemon and maybe apricot. Lovely wine! "
"Absolutely loved this - husband splurged on an anniversary wine and this was delicious! Don‚Äôt expect a NZ because this is from Cali; does bear some resemblance but is bright, smooth, and well balanced. Try this!"
"Straw Color in the glass. Floral, Spices, Vanilla, Stone Fruit and Honey on the nose. Peach üçë Pear üçê and Ripe Honey Dew Melon üçà on the palate. Lime Peel, Orange Peel, Peppery Spices and a creamy long Finish This is ..My favorite SB from California...."
"Fuller bodied Sauvignon Blanc that explodes with flavor, while retaining a crispness and levity that you‚Äôd hope to experience from a top quality SB. Apricot, peach, pear and lemon curd notes most prominent. "
"On the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, falls between the stone fruit driven and the tart tropical fruit driven types. More like a white Bordeaux- well balanced, a degree of minerality. Rather high ABV, but not evident in the palate. Very pricey. P246"
"Delivers year over year and this is a staple for me. This is a ripe, plump & juicy SB with big complex flavors. Fragrant aromas of ripe peach, pear, lemon, pineapple, honey, vanilla & honeysuckle. Palate is lush with creamy melon, peach, guava, lemon grass, butter & mango citrus curd. Finish is long with soft minerality, honey & light spice. This is such a huge flavor unique SB with creamy textures & paired perfectly with Thai chicken noodle soup. Dry, med+ body & med+ acidity. Pale yellow color. Excellent quality!"
"The 2021 Merry Edwards Sauvignon Blanc from Russian River Valley is made to pair with cold asparagus soup. It has everything: pale straw color; crisp acidity; slight creaminess from 4 month sur lie in 18% new French Oak; and most importantly, a complex bouquet. Bouquets of tropical fruits like mangoes and pineapples initially but also has citrus and honeydews at the end. Just a lovely way to celebrate spring. Had at DCA restaurant student banquet"
"Lemon, tropical fruits and a touch of vanilla on the nose. Easy drinker and just the right amount of acidity. Ripe Mellon, pineapple, pink grapefruit and a nice touch of minerality. Not your classic sauv blanc but delicious none the less!"
"ASTOUNDING

One of my top Sauv Blancs, this stuff is just a damn treat whenever I open it. I call this the secret weapon from the Queen of California Pinot. Paired with scallops & lemon parmesan risotto with broccoli, always amazing. Don't get so distracted by bulls at the rodeo that you don't check out ponies like this one!

The creamiest mouthfeel paints the palate with flavors of grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle & lemon pulp
Insane integration. 93 pts"
"4.3 I just love this wine.

Although this is the last vintage where they sourced fruit from non estate vineyards. This gives much more fruit characteristics than the estate vineyards. From 2019 on, it will be more mineral driven. I prefer the fruit with this one, so buy the 2018s while you can! This does see French oak for fermentation, 18% new. 6 months on lees.

Fresh acidity with med+ body, sumptuous mouthfeel.
Guava, peach, spicy pear, lemon zest, and chalk.

Delicious."
"Peaches and tropical fruit. Some oak and butter, like a Chardonnay for some reason. Otherwise, very concentrated with decent body"
"4.3. Not as good as 2018 but still the best Sauvignon Blanc from USA. Tropical fruit, caramelized apple, and grass. Well done!"
"Fruit, intense honey initially, buttery with more citrusy fruit/nectar emerging in the middle‚Ä¶dry and crisp‚Ä¶light bodied‚Ä¶amazing wine‚Ä¶"
"Yum. Cantaloupe, guava, pineapple, lavender honey, elderflower, baking yeast, cream. Medium bodied with a nice oily texture and high acidity. Long finish. A little bit of heat at 14%. Very nice."
"Aromas and flavors of guava, pineapple, candied fruit and exotic spices.  100% oak but extremely well integrated.  My wife took a half bottle with her on her business trip.  "
"New fish last night for me  ( Monchong üêü) if your keeping a fish count. üòâ.  Shrimp too in bamboo üçÉ 

Big Merry Edward‚Äôs fan so when this was on the menu.  Yes please. 

Big style Sauvignon Blanc ( barrel fermented ) with richness and creaminess ( lovely with coconut rice)

Lots of tropical nuances ( guava and mango) with a citrus focus.  Light sprinkling of baking spices. Nice thick white to match the array of food flavours.  This üç∑ can age but still a treat early.  Mahalo"
"91pts. 95WS 
Wine spectator what were you smoking ? 
Fermented in barrel with bottanage and using special clone of SB
Smooth. Rather intense flavors of pineapple, marmalade honeysuckle and honey melon 
Medium plus acid with a touch of residual sugar and good amount of oak  dairy and brioche 
A good finish 
But not amazing"
"Stone fruit, melon, restrained citrus, with oak and cream notes. Fuller body that most other expressions of this grape. Very interesting and drinkable."
"One of finest sav blanc I hv tasted . Balanced acidity , fruity and balanced sweetness"
"Peach, butter, cream, grass. Not as herbaceous as other savy bs I‚Äôve had recently because of the oak influence but definitely a cool spin on the grape. "
"Perfect. Nose, first taste, like fairy dust blown in your face.Balanced acids with floral notes, Gorgeous color. At the Bull & Bear in the WA.Glides down your palate."
Outstanding California sb.  Medium body medium plus acidity. Outstanding flavors of pear melon mango tangerine lemon grapefruit  cream butter grass saline minerality 
Floral scents.  Good fruit flavors with a balance of minerals that leave a slight pinch in the cheek on the swallow.
"Approaching Condrieu levels of elegance combined with approachability. Super fruity, super delicious, super super. Tropical like a New Zealand but with touches of oak that California can‚Äôt resist. There is almost certainly some RS but it is still dry and refreshing while being expressive. Beautiful wine. Peach and citrus with honey and minerals."
"Unlike any Sauvignon Blanc I've had before and this is why - ""We use a specific mix of clones ‚Äì two-thirds Shenandoah (Clone 1) and one-third Sauvignon Musqu√© ‚Äì that results in a wine brimming with floral and tropical fruit aromatics with a citrusy, juicy core. Barrel fermentation and twice-weekly lees stirring help us create the characteristic creamy texture and rich body"". Dry, medium to medium+ acidity with medium+ to full body and 14% abv. On the complex palate, creamy tropical fruit and pineapple (continued)"
"Despite the mentions of pear, I mostly get melon and pear notes throughout, with a bit of a buttery taste and smooth finish at the end. Fairly long flavor profile. Really tasty wine, would buy again. Worth the price. "
"Really good wine. Worth the money, oak, gooseberry, starfruit, pear, white flowers, cat pee, pineapple, butter. Very complex. I‚Äôm not a Sauv blanc guy but with the oak and malo this is like a very aromatic white burgundy."
"Pale golden in color, nice long thin legs; aromas of peach, melon, guava, pineapple, honeysuckle & grass on the nose; flavors of pear, grapefruit, apple, lime zest, cream & minerals on the palate with a kiss of almond; off-dry, medium body, moderate acidity, medium tangy finish; very smooth yet complex SB, crisp & refreshing with only slightest hint of oak, amazingly delicious with a great mouthfeel, one of the best SBs I‚Äôve had.

"Soft and elegant with low acidity. Citrus notes layered with butter and oak. Long, delicious finish. As much as I enjoyed this wine, I've had other SB for less than half the price that were just as good. "
"Deserving of it's reputation. Pale lemon hue with a medium nose of vanilla, jasmine and apricot. Heidi von Der Mehden has overseen things since Merry retired and the decision to barrel-ferment adds a lush complexity to this that I think gets overlooked by sauv lovers.

Acidity is medium-high, softer as one might expect and with those creamy tones more often fund in chardonnays. 

Vanilla again in the pallette along with crisp minerals and tart pear at the end. Pricey? Maybe, but worth it. It's a unique wine. "
I want to give this 5 stars but holy cow this is an incredible wine. Beautiful mouthfeel and the fruit is harmonious. Comes off as off-dry even though its not (a plus for me). Highly highly recommend you go out and try this beauty!
"Pale straw in color. Tropical fruit nose. Crisp Creamy flavors of Mango, Peach, pineapple, Notes of Lemon/Lime Zest. Medium acidity paired with a Salmon Sushi app‚Ä¶On Point!"
"PNP. Intense golden color. Coconut cream pie, lemon rind, and subtle pear. Dry and very creamy palate. Soft, but persistent acidity."
"Fantastic. Much more depth and complexity than most SBs around the traps, while still staying fresh, bright and fruit forward. A real winner "
"Dry, crisp Sauvignon Blanc from a favorite producer. Baked apple, floral, hints of oak, long supple finish. Enjoyed with seafood lunch"
This is my favorite Sauvignon Blanc! A beautiful tropical beach in a glass... hints of pineapple and maybe tangerine blossoms. Delicious! 
Beautiful golden color with nose of lemon grass pine needles and vanilla. Well balanced body with taste consistent of the nose.
"Crisp, bright acidity with limestone and cut grass.  Finish is all stone fruits, peach and pear, and goes on and on.  Wife's favorite SB."
"Stunning bouquet of melon, tropical fruit and pear! Fresh spice and subtle citrus on the tongue! Bright acidic finish! Instant favorite!"
"This is a fascinating wine.  I get honeyed peach and tropical fruits, a bit of minerals and lime.  Lovely rich body.  A top class SB, for sure."
" 
Fresh and spicy right up front. With a very long and layered end. Rich with baked apple pineapple peach and citrus. Finishing clean and acidic! 

"
Unlike any other Sauvignon blanc I‚Äôve tasted and I‚Äôm general not a fan of sav blanc. Has a richness and a bit of sweetness. A standout. Tasted at winery in 2023
Amazing wine.  The fruity and creamy nature of the grape takes over your palate from the first sip.  Gorgeous white. 
Quaffable! Oaked SB - somewhere btwn a Sancerre and a Napa chard. 
A delicious Sauvignon Blanc outstanding- oak pear peach melon butter fantastic!
"Delicious. Citrus on the nose.  Flowers and soft minerals at first sip.  Goes a little flat at the end, but overall excellent.  I see why it‚Äôs highly reviewed.  "
"As good as I remember. Barrel fermented Sav Blanc. Lovely palate of banana, peach, orange blossom, lemon, vanilla and hint of honey. Medium bodied palate adds some beautiful toasted oak and spice notes. A unique and complex SB that always delivers!"
Beautiful bright wine.  Light blond almost clear color.  Smeels of kettle corn crisp but not green.  Sweet floral flavors.  Quick finish that is clean and effortless.  Ripe sweet citrus ends with a nice supple ending. 
The best Sauvignon blanc I've ever had. A hint of oak with a lot of pear and nuttiness. Very fruity and complex. A lot of flavors. Nice with a heavy sauce or a buttery fish. Will absolutely get this again. It is not to b passed up.
We love Merry's Pinot's now I can add this fabulous Sav Blanc to my list of summer go to wines. The light Oak infusion is a wonderful touch and really takes this wine to a new level. We drank this a Bouchon's in Yountville and it's was a perfect pairing to my grilled Swordfish dish. Top marks to Merry for another wonderful masterpiece.
"A lovely if somewhat overpriced Sauvignon Blanc. This vibrant wine has a delicate floral fragrance of jasmine, honeysuckle, fruit blossoms, along with orange and lime zest. On the palate, fruit flavors donate with citrus and stone fruit, including white peach, nectarine, pink apple, and pear. For complexity, notes of fresh sweet bread, hazelnut, and dried flowers. Long finish that opens into notes of grapefruit. Nice minerality, some acidity. Elegant overall. Pair with salads, fresh dishes, and lite fare. "
"Amazing sauv blanc.  Really different.  Tropical feuits Nd melon heavy up front with a bit of that musty barnyard thing and some lemon grass.  Long lingering finish with medium plus acid.scott white, thanks for sharing."
"I usually don't prefer Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine is exceptional! Pale yellow in color with light tears. Nose of tropical citrus fruits, including pineapple and lemon, with an incredible floral element. More ripe citrus fruits on the palate, alongside pear and light mineral. The wine is well-balanced, with flavors and acidity in delectable unison, and offers a medium (-) finish."
"This is an amazing sb. Something between NZ sauvignon blanc and Californian. The nose is beautiful with herbaceous aromas. Palate is smooth and velvety with oak, butter and lovely tastes. Very surprising wine!    "
"Absolutely excellent Sauvignon Blanc! This wine is a crisp, straw color. The nose is extremely effervescent with notes of pineapple, citrus, and other tropical fruits. There is moderate acidity present. The taste is quite fresh, reminiscent of a warm summer afternoon by the beach in Santa Monica. We see lots of citrus fruits, peaches, and pineapple notes. This is a medium bodied wine with a nice finish. Definitely recommend! "
"Tastes more like a big Napa oaked Chardonnay. Peach yogurt, apricot, butter, saline. Bright acidity that integrates nicely in the creamy tree fruits that dominate. Pale/medium gold. Reminds me of the ZD Chardonnay."
"Straw colored. Full, ripe, and complex with tropical notes of melon and pineapple dominating over white citrus. Rounded out with floral notes of honeysuckle and a pleasant oak influence. This is a beautiful wine."
"Happy International Sauvignon Blanc Day!!Fruity and juicy, tropical nose, medium bodied and medium acidity, 14.1% ABV.  Pineapple, key line, peach and vanilla notes. I'm not a big SB fan but this one I could drink all night long! Paired well with jumbo lump crab cakes, roasted Yukon gold potatoes and grilled asparagus. Yum yum. "
Beautifully unique  Sauv Blanc with a grapefruit citrus and honeysuckle nose accented with great acidity. Rounded feel with a smoothness between a NZ Sauv Blanc and a traditional Sancere. Soft fruit makes it a pleasure to drink!
"There are bright but delicate aromas of green grass, grapefruit, melon and herbs. The palate is medium bodied with balanced notes of sweet tropical fruits and a crisp herbal, citrus acidity. Even three years old, this white is still drinking beautifully! A cellar-friendly Sauvignon Blanc for sure! "
"The pour is liquid gold and the nose is just as lovely - some oak smoothed out by melon and a whiff of fresh-cut flowers.  The opening and closing notes are remarkably smooth. There is some size and a bit of butter here, so I'd go with poultry over fish as accompaniment. The quality is undeniable."
"¬†This pale straw colored Sauvignon Blanc from Merry Edwards opens with a very faint banana and delicate cantaloupe bouquet.  This wine is full bodied, balanced, round and rich for a Sauvignon Blanc. Flavors of mild vanilla and cream soda blend with a hint of lime, melon, and honey. The finish is dry and fades away nicely. 92 pts."
"Freshly cut grass is attenuated by a pleasant mix of kiwi, lime and tarragon. Medium bodied the expression of fruits on the palate included limestone, lemon oil, white peaches and elderflower. A lovely aperitif to sip on a sunny day sitting on the patio. Savour the subtle flavors and let the aromas speak to you. We felt transported by this wine with a green bean and asparagus salad with almond. This is not a wine you‚Äôd quaff down with food in heavy sauce. 93pts"
"Drank for Mother's Day. Light yellow straw in color. Nose of peach, pear and green apple with some mineral notes. Tastes of green apple, pear and peach. Refreshing tartness and acidity. Buttery finish and mouthfeel like a California Chardonnay. As the wine opens up it develops honey notes. Very nice wine from a consistent excellent producer.  Currently my favorite sauvignon blanc. "
"Might be the best Sauv Blanc I've had to date. #InstantClassic
Nectarine, apple and lemon as the foundation with gripping minerality and traces of vanilla.

Elegant and dare I say graceful...... Bring on the warm weather, lobster rolls and evenings by the fire-pit."
"Succulent and juicy , with sweet, fresh baby- pineapple, lime, papaya and candied pink grapefruit peel flavors that sing with purity and focus, set on a supple frame and featuring fresh acidity that weaves in and out.
For all the intensity this shows an effortlessness and elegance!"
I‚Äôve never had a winery tasting end with a Sauvignon Blanc but in this case it works:  zero citrus and ample pear & peach  makes this a non traditional dessert wine.  It‚Äôs an amazing achievement:  6 months in used oak create a unique experience 
"This may be the best SB i've tasted till this date.  For someone who dislikes the SB in general,  this wine is a game changer.  Perfect acidity.  Doesn't have an excessive grapefruit or passion fruit aroma overpowering.  Has a bit of density to it, giving it a bit more chunk. Finishes with a briny mineral touch.  This is no poolside sipper !  Pairs beautifully with greasy foods."
"Very aromatic, with ripe stone fruits and dense tropical essences on the nose. Dry, the palate is rich and fruity, dominated by nectarines, peaches, mandarines and just some grassiness. Slightly oaked taste, well balanced by its high acidity and ripeness. The finish is dry and citric, makes it a great complement to any sea seafood. A note of caution, the bottle goes down very fast. "
"Fresh and fruity flavors of pineapple and tree fruits. Golden color featuring amazing aromas. Compares with the best New Zealand SB out there. Appreciate the medium bodied,crisp acidity with oaky undertones "
"Aromas of pear, melon, grapefruit, mango, and vanilla. Creamy mouthfeel, with flavors of stone fruit, lemon, pineapple, and mineral on the finish. Beautiful Sauvignon Blanc! 60% Sauvignon Blanc, 40% Sauvignon Musqu√©. "
"This white wine is on the fruity and has a pale yellow color. It's very easy to drink üò¨.  Has aromas of ripe melons, minerals, and peaches. On the palate is complex with a fruity punch of apricots, nectarines, and peaches. "
"The 2018 is better now it has another year of age in the bottle. The best bottles we've had have always been at least 3-4 years old. We plan to cellar a few bottles and try them 4,5 and 6 years in the bottle. Wouldn't try that with any other SBs, but fairly certain the Merry Edwards will improve with a few more years than the basic SB."

"THANK YOU BETH!!

This was such a generous gift Boy a wonderful person I met through Vivino. One of my fav grapes in a different Style. 

Shiny yellow with golden hues. This is a heavier Style than I am used to. Med+ body and 14% vol. 
Scents of lemon, pineapple and papaya. Really juicy mouthfeel with an exotic touch. Tangy acidity but at the same time nearly a creamy texture. Long limey and fresh finish with some herbal notes. 

Stunner wine by a Pinot queen üòä"
"- 5 Vineyards
- 6 months in oak (sur lie)
- Absolutely killer. Bright, ripe fruits of green apple, pear, grapefruit, stone fruit, minerality, creamy mouthfeel (thanks to sur lie), beautiful and very long finish. Best Californian Sauvignon Blanc I've tasted.

Tasting sample"
"Tied with Mark David's Transitus as the best sauv blancs I've had. They managed to take a varietal I generally regard as simple with limited variation that attempts to win the crowd with sweetness, and made it into a sleek, finessed version that tamed the fruit and made this a serious wine. Reminds me of the new serious white zin trend, I could get used to more sauv blancs being made like this."
"An extremely well composed white Californian wine. Nice fragrance of jasmine, and honeysuckle. The palate is dominated by citrus, stone fruits and minerality. An exceptional fresh and delicate wine. I was introduced to this wine at a Danish restaurant. It is impossible to get this brand in Norway and Sweden (State monopoly in both countries). If anybody knows where to get hold of this wine please let me know. This wine got 93 points by Wine Spectator.

Highly recommended
             
Cheers my Vivino friends
"
"The Merry Edwards booth was a highlight of the wine show. There were six Pinot Noirs, a Chardonnay, and this outstanding Sauvignon Blanc. The addition of 30% Sauvignon Musqu√© gave this wine a completely new dimension, with notes of honeysuckle, cantaloupe, ginger, and white peach. A wet gravel minerality gave it some solid structure to balance the forward fruit. Far and away the most unique SB I've ever had. Worth every penny! "
"Last ME I had was the 2015. This is equally as good! Great SB with a wonderful balance of minerality, a citrusy fruit  forward taste and acidity. RRV never disappoints. This drives more to a feel of France than anything else produced in The USA. "
"Unusually rich and full-bodied Sauv Blanc - Russian River Valley does not disappoint.  High in alcohol at 14.1% but no trace of burn.  Moderate oak, smooth vanilla, caramelized pear.  Very, very good and terrific value."
"This has been one of my favorite Sauvignon Blanc's.  To the nose,  citrus and a slight floral aroma. The hits you right away, plenty of peach, apricot and pear flavors. A nice touch of lemon (and I'm not a lemon fan. A very nice dry finish and definitely a touch acidic with these fruits. A very good SB!!"
"Most Sauvignon Blancs are dry, boring, and uneventful‚Äînot this one! This is the first wine of this grape that I‚Äôve enjoyed in a while."
"Light golden color with a nice nose that is soft, smooth and fruity on the palate, accenting the food flavors and recalling the sometimes cool sunny slopes of the Russian River Valley. Love this Sauvignon Blanc and it‚Äôs genius wine maker Merry Edwards. "
"Flashy and high - great Sauvignon Blanc!!! Low reflex almost light yellow clear. Odors of floral discreet perfume. Start gives a nice tingle on the toungue even though acidity isn't high. Very smooth going down and elegant aftertaste with some hidden citricity remaining in mouthtaste. Fresh and crisp. A plus also for the price, very fair."
"A pronounced floral bouquet.  The glass opens with a taste of sweet cherry, followed by melon accented with lemon.  The finish is slightly sweet, accented with honey.  Strong acidity and minerality throughout.  An outstanding Sauvignon Blanc!"
"2017 Sauvignon Blanc - lively and tropical on the nose. Pineapple candy, ripe nectarine and white peach. A little yeast influence with the time on lees giving a little more richness rather than imparting taste. A great balance on the palate. Soft mango fruit and a rounded texture. Excellent 92pts not sure I‚Äôve ever given a new world Sauv Blanc a higher score. "
"Visiting again one of my favorite wineries from California; the Mary Edwards Sauvignon Blanc 2014. 100% Sauvignon Blanco and Sonoma county the wine has scents of oak, pineapple, peach, and persimmon. Flavors of oak, pineapple, vanilla, and persimmon. Everytime I visit this winery, I buy a case of this wine. I also keep a library of the 2014 - Present Day. My recommendation? Buy it!"
"Really excellent SB that lived up to the hype. It has a distinctively plush and rounded mouthfeel that is outstanding, but doesn‚Äôt sacrifice any of the typical SB crispness. I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to say I taste peach and stone fruit, but there is a beautiful melon aspect that tames the citrus. Easily the best Californian SB I‚Äôve ever had - pleases both traditional SB enthusiasts and Chardonnay fans who prefer more body. "
"Big, bold and almost chardonnay, but with a very citrusy finish. Grapefruit, and possibly pineapple flavors give way to a brashness and dryness that screams chard, but begs you to drink more, until it's gone. Will she for years to come, but is plenty ready now. Picked up at the vineyard and I wish I had more."
"On the nose:
Apple cider, honey, light vanilla.

On the palette:
Balanced perfectly, tongue coating. Lemon, honey, oak, vanilla. 

From a non sav blanc lover, this is the best sav blanc I‚Äôve ever had."
"I‚Äôm a rookie at the Sauv Blanc, however if they are all like this, I‚Äôm all onboard."
Crowd pleaser.  Peach. Citrus.  Medium body.  On the dryer side. 
Fantastic.  Soon to be Mom‚Äôs favorite wine.  She just doesn‚Äôt know it yet.
This is the best Sauvignon Blanc from California That I have ever tasted

Amazing and gentle Sauvignon! Nothing to dislike!
Drinking amazing right now. Wow! 
Just what the doctor ordered on a 108 degree day!  Outstanding Sauv!
Crisp with layered floral notes and light fruit. Multi-faceted but not heavy.
This ins great! Quite different. 
A really beautiful wine ‚Äî peach and grapefruit with nice minerals and stone fruit on the finish. 
Ive been a Marlborough NZ Sauv Blanc guy and am still learning about the good California Sauv Blancs.  But i can say this one is excellent!
Tropical fruits and some oak in the nose and on the palate. Lush long finish

Peach pear and nice minerality. Great finish a
"Maybe the best SB I've ever had. Pears, melon, hints of apple and lemon blend together in layers of flavor that just keep coming. Just terrific."
"White gold color; nose of yellow flowers; palate smooth, buttery honeydew melon on the long finish. Surprisingly un-grassy.  "
"Beautiful roundness, buttery, slight fruit and slight sweetness bring this white wine together to a delicious, fruity finish."
"Love this! Perfect for a summer day by the pool! Nice mouthfeel, and a slight creaminess.  Tropical notes as if I am on a beautiful Caribbean beach."
"Big and round, tropical fruits, melon, pear, super balanced with great acidity, loved it!"
"Excellent a great example of what a Sauvignon Blanc should be. Fruity, elegant and crisp. Consistent top performer, Marry has it down. "
Not overpowering. Not a blanc fan in general but this was magnificent. 
Wow. Delicious. Smooth; rich with the brightness of a savignon blanc
"Excellent white‚Äîrich, but not overdone, fruity but balanced with mineral, and distinctive."
OMG - best  Sauvignon blanc believe I have ever had. My quest is now to find more. 
"Enjoyed this wine with a fish oriented small plates meal at the Easterly restaurant in St Thomas on 2/19/22. Absolutely delicious. Well balanced, not overly minerally or likely, or flinty but just great. Love it. "
Buttery yet silky smooth with vanilla and spice 
"unusual, yummy sauvignon blanc with incredible oaked-aged fruit flavors.  best fresh and a bit below ambient temperature.  must try, at least to compare to.  drink it regularly if you can afford it."
"An interesting and delicious sauv blanc. It has the brightness and acid of a sauv blanc (typical notes like melon and peach) but the fullness and opulence of a refined chardonnay. The oak comes through as an undertone, not a confection. Would buy a case if I could find it!"
"Blind, I thought this was Viognier. It‚Äôs very floral, ripe, with a creamy, round texture you rarely see in Sauvignon Blanc. It also has lower acidity than what I would expect from Sauv Blanc, but enough to mostly balance out the opulent fruit. This isn‚Äôt typical by any means, but it‚Äôs fun and complex. Drink now "
"I'm already back for more of this Sauvignon Blanc (and I'm not big on whites generally). I'm enjoying like I'd normally a good red, and GF likes it too. So, rich and flavored.  Must chill, tho. It's pricey, but a treat. It's pushing 5* in my book."
"Really something. My favourite California white thus far, by far. Not the crisp sav blanc I‚Äôm used to with the NZ wines, but much richer. A bit sweet, but a very complex flavour that goes through a few twists and turns before leaving you with a nice touch of sour and bitter ‚Äî in a good way."
"Light, refreshing and yes delicious "
Lovely. Had with French laundry tasting menu
This may be the perfect Sauv Blanc. The nose is light and lemony but a medium body on the palate. Notes of citrus upfront with a finish off melon rind. A very well-balanced acidity and dryness.
Best Sav Blanc on the market 
Unreal as always. Loved it. So well balanced and dynamic. 
Cold Spring wine store. Amazing stand alone full bodied alcohol forward Saudi gnome Blanc goes great with lemon tarragon chicken.  Yes!
"Great floral notes.  Tropical fruit and full bodied sb, yet the right amount of acid to balance "

"Pear, Mellon, good acid. A great pairing with sushi. "
Great. More muted due to the bottle aging I suppose.

"Lemon and stone fruit on the nose smooth well balanced, great acid."
Wow! Wow! Wow! Who oaks a Sauvignon Blanc? Love it
A real treat at this price with a citrus tang and great for the next 15 years
Before flight home to Moscow perfect!
Very drinkable and elegant.
Oaked sav blanc.  Very unique and enjoyable 
"Barrel fermented in neutral oak; weekly battonage; creamy, floral, fruity, lime, full body; good with Thai food or spicy food."
Great refreshing wine with pear and melon flavors 
Excellent white with a balanced acidity.
About as good as a sauv b gets. Bold ripe fruit.
Very rich. Balanced. 
"Ooohhhh yum. Dangerously good. Crisp, citrusy. "
This wine is still drinking great! Paired well with Northern Thai spices too!
"One of the yummiest crisp whites I‚Äôve tried. Thought about giving a 4.5, but decided naked people on the label make this a perfect 5.0 :)"
"Beautifully put together, creamy lush cantaloupe and green fruit with refreshing acidity; ebullient, tropics meets an English garden"
"Fantastic,  unique and my all-time favorite"
Nice balance with yellow aromas 
Another excellent vintage of this benchmark sauvignon blanc.
"Perfectly balanced. Smooth, ripe fruit character with acid throughout. Lemon, lime, ripe apple. "
"Elegant nose with light veggie hues, nicely zesty@palate."
"Very different Sauvignon blanc, rich, nice oak, peach, smooth."
Absolutely amazing. So smooth with almost no detectable acidity!
Aromas of rich peachy fruits and floral notes. Creamy texture on the palate with a nice acidity. More of an exotic style Sauvignon blanc from Russian river! 
"After visiting the winery earlier this year, we decided to pop a bottle of this lovely juice and reminisce.  Ahhh...just as pure and tasty as the memory."
"Undertone of oak, lemon citrus, a bit sweetness; a great wine for the summer, light and fresh. Better to enjoy with meal. Lack of complexity by itself "
"Terrific Sav Blanc. Nice acidity and great mouth feel. Very complex with plenty of fruit, tangerine, grapefruit and melon. Floral on the nose. Highly recommend."
"Just the perfect Sauvignon Blanc. Extremely floral nose. Full of peach, apricot, pineapple. Just the right amount of citrus. Nice minerality. Enjoyed at the Modern."
Been awhile since I have some ME Sav Blanc but her juice is wonderful. Love the light sweet notes (Apple and peach) as well as a good balance of citrus/acidity 
"This SB is delicious. Even though I like crisper and more acidic style this one is in its own class. Little creamy and smooth, with some oak notes and mango and citrus."
"Poached pear, green apple on the nose, full body with long finish. Great balance. So, so smooth. Just a delicious wine. Great body‚Äîyou can tell this has rested in the lees. "

Glad I had one more bottle of this wine to celebrate with! Saw 7 seahorses on this trip, so seahorse prop time! And time to dance üíÉüèº 
Aromas of lemon, melon, pineapple, and minerals. 
Palate is delicious! It adds in white flowers, salinity, and happiness.

"Great Sauvignon Blanc, drunk from a magnum with a couple of years. This isn't built for age like a BDX Blanc, but the large format and a couple of years has definitely added layers.  Lots of tropical notes, with some guava, pineapple, elderflower, orange, and orange peel, with pineapple, key lime, and a little coconut on the palate. Some stone minerality too, and just a little nutty (cashew?) note."
"Merry Edwards 2020 Sauvignon Blanc. Done in French oak with a yeast stir every week for 10 weeks. Light straw color with a nose of honey, honeydew melon, casaba melon & floral.  The drink features notes of honeydew, casaba melon, mango, pear, peach, tropical, pink grapefruit, pineapple & vanilla on a French oak finish. This beautiful, SB will pair well with Asian food, seafood or chicken. A great stand-alone as well. Been a while since I've had a good SB.  4.5 stars.

"This is a dry mildly acidic wine with notes of citrus, tropical fruit, and light vanilla on the nose. The palate has notes of white peach and mango with wonderful mineral undertones. One of my favorite white wines"
"Clear pale lemon in color with medium intensity and notes of grapefruit, candied tangerine peel, and lemon heads. This wine is dry with medium plus acid, medium body, medium minus alcohol, and a medium finish. 90/100"
Solid Sav Blanc. Citrus is foremost but oak influence is evident. Pears and peaches primarily with creamy melon and some tropical grapefruit-y zest to finish. üëåüèΩ
A little young right now but delicious. High acidity with beautiful color and taste. Heavier with slight creaminess. Can't wait to revisit this one in a few years.
"Best Sauvignon Blanc I had in a long time. Feels quite sweet with tree fruit notes (pear, apple) and a nice citrusy finish. Well balanced and smooth, goes in really easy!"
"Sauvignon Blanc tasting in Tokyo:  Everyone had this as their second favorite.  A softer palate then the others with melon in the palate nice acidity and a great, somewhat sweet, finish"
"My second favorite Sauvignon Blanc ever. Beautiful lemon and citrus notes along with honey and perfect amount of acidity for backbone! Not dry at all, juicy right to the end."
"A truly excellent Californian SB. Subtle honey, peach, lemon, with a nice bit of salinity and minerality."
"A light plus bodied pale yellow white with flavors of citrus, peach, some apple, noticeable minerality, slight cream from malolactic fermentation, and subtle oak flavors."
"I hate Sauvignon blanc.  But ok this is good.  Loads of pineapple, something a little stinky.  Sour and tropical and slightly weird.  Like that dance teacher on the Gilmore girls."
"Pure juicy fruit with a hint of creaminess and a citrus backbone.  Full disclosure: this is consistently my favorite SB.  Whenever I find it on a menu, I order it and have never been disappointed.  "
"Pale green with no rim MEDIUM+LEGS STRONG AROMA grapefruit tropical fruit grass STRONG FLAVOR grapefruit lime mandarin orange earth MEDIUM BODY MEDIUM+ACID VERY LONG DURATION 

Excellent with salmon"
"Best Sav Blanc ever! I am not a SB fan but this is amazing.  It is spendy, but amazing‚Ä¶not overly citrus, some vanilla."
"A big number and a fantastic SB..  Consumed in Chicago,  I was going to do a great Pinot but none left in stock tonight.. 

Anyway,  beautiful peach and pear,  extended white fruit layers.. .."
"Smooth, minerality, peach, apricot.  Delicious!  Definitely buy it again!"
"95; as far as California SB is concerned, this is one to try. Benchmark SB without a doubt.  Lightly oaked, nicely textured body, just the right acidity.  Put it on your list!"
Really crisp and wonderful. Peach pear citrus
Forget about the grass and cat urine that so often fill your nose with sauvignon blanc. This is something different and enterily wonderful.
"Incredible white wine! I don‚Äôt drink much white but this bottle is so welcoming and bright, hints of green apple. @[1|50229936|James Beecham] I think you‚Äôd love this Russian River white wine! "
"Unleashed tropical thiol aromatics - smells amazing. Flavors are more well rounded than the aroma would suggest. Smells like an acid bomb, but this wine has impeccable balance."

Ohh and a sweet citrus finish

"Pretty good, balanced, tropical fruits, round, oak is there, good length and complexity. well made Cali sauv."

"
"A new vintage. Light peach, butter, pear, melon and vanilla. Still my favourite Sauvignon Blanc. "

"Outstanding CA Sauvignon Blanc.  Fresh, nice minerality, bright fruit, refreshing acidity, clean finish."
Pretty good Sauv Blanc‚Ä¶. Not as crisp and acidic as would have imagined‚Ä¶. Some tart on the palate‚Ä¶ delicate body!

"Benchmark Sauvignon Blanc!ü§©üëåüèªüç∑

In a perfect condition to drink.
Classic California styled without green bell pepper and asparagus notes.
A delicious oak touch with a hint of vanilla."

"I was told Merry Edwards hated making this wine. Too bad she is clearly a genius and the hate doesn‚Äôt show. Might be the most well balanced Sauvignon Blanc I‚Äôve ever had, with notes of ripe peach, melon and guava. Lemon peel in the back. Yum!"
